Tasks generated and saved to specs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/tasks.md

Summary:
- Total task count: 52
- Task count per user story:
    - US1 (Module 1): 3 tasks
    - US2 (Module 2): 5 tasks
    - US3 (Module 3): 6 tasks
    - US4 (Module 4): 4 tasks
    - US5 (Module 5): 5 tasks
    - US6 (Module 6): 4 tasks

    - US8 (Module 8): 3 tasks
- Parallel opportunities identified: After the Foundational Phase, Module Development phases can be worked on concurrently.
- Independent test criteria for each story: Provided in tasks.md for each phase.
- Suggested MVP scope: Phase 1 (Setup) and Phase 2 (Foundational), then Module 1 (Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence).
- Format validation: All tasks follow the checklist format.
