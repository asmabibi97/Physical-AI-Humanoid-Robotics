# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics book! This module explores how to build the "brain" for your AI-powered robots, focusing on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 to achieve advanced perception, simulation, and humanoid navigation.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   Clearly explain the roles and capabilities of NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 in a robotics development pipeline.
*   Understand the critical concepts of synthetic data generation and its importance for training AI models.
*   Grasp the principles of Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) for robot perception.
*   Comprehend various path planning techniques used for autonomous humanoid navigation.

## Module Structure

This module is divided into the following chapters:

*   **3.1 NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: Scalable simulation and synthetic data for AI training.
*   **3.2 NVIDIA Isaac ROS**: Hardware-accelerated VSLAM and AI perception.
*   **3.3 Nav2**: Building robust navigation systems for humanoid robots.
