# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics book! This module introduces you to the core middleware concepts of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the "nervous system" for controlling humanoid robots.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, including Nodes, Topics, and Services.
*   Connect a Python agent to a ROS 2 controller using the `rclpy` library.
*   Describe the structure and purpose of URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for defining humanoid robot models.
*   Mentally trace how commands and data flow through a robot's communication system.

## Module Structure

This module is divided into the following chapters:

*   **1.1 Introduction to ROS 2**: An overview of ROS 2 and its role in robotics.
*   **1.2 Nodes, Topics, and Services**: Diving deep into the core communication paradigms of ROS 2.
*   **1.3 Python to ROS with `rclpy`**: Practical examples of how to interface with ROS 2 using Python.
*   **1.4 URDF for Humanoids**: Understanding how robot physical structures are described.
