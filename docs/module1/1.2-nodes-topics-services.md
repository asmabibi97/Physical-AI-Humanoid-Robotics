# 1.2 Nodes, Topics, and Services: The Core of ROS 2 Communication

In ROS 2, effective communication between different parts of your robot's software is paramount. This communication is built upon a few fundamental concepts: Nodes, Topics, and Services. Understanding these is key to building any ROS 2 application.

## Nodes: The Workers of the Robot

Imagine your robot's software as a team of specialized workers. Each worker (or group of workers) is responsible for a specific task. In ROS 2, these workers are called **Nodes**.

*   **Definition**: A Node is an executable process that performs computation. Typically, a ROS 2 system will consist of many nodes working together, each designed for a specific purpose (e.g., one node to control the motors, another to process camera data, a third to plan navigation paths).
*   **Modularity**: Nodes promote modularity. You can easily develop, test, and debug individual functionalities without affecting the entire system. If one node crashes, the rest of the system can often continue to operate.
*   **Isolation**: Each node runs as an independent process, providing a degree of isolation.

## Topics: Asynchronous Data Streaming

When workers in a team need to share continuous streams of information, they don't constantly interrupt each other. Instead, they might use a whiteboard or a shared display where information is regularly updated. In ROS 2, this concept is implemented through **Topics**.

*   **Definition**: A Topic is a named bus over which nodes exchange messages asynchronously. It's a publish/subscribe communication model.
*   **Publishers and Subscribers**:
    *   **Publisher**: A node that sends messages to a specific topic.
    *   **Subscriber**: A node that receives messages from a specific topic.
*   **One-to-Many Communication**: Multiple nodes can publish to the same topic, and multiple nodes can subscribe to the same topic. This allows for flexible and decoupled communication.
*   **Message Types**: Every topic has an associated message type, which defines the structure of the data being transmitted (e.g., `sensor_msgs/msg/Image` for camera data, `std_msgs/msg/String` for simple text).

**Example Scenario**: A camera node might *publish* image data to an `/camera/image_raw` topic. An image processing node would *subscribe* to this topic, perform some analysis, and then *publish* its results to a `/camera/processed_image` topic. A display node could then *subscribe* to the processed image topic to show the output to a human operator.

## Services: Synchronous Request/Response

Sometimes, a worker needs a specific piece of information or wants another worker to perform a specific action and then report back immediately. This is not a continuous stream but a one-time request and a one-time response. In ROS 2, this is handled by **Services**.

*   **Definition**: A Service is a synchronous request/response communication model between nodes.
*   **Client and Server**:
    *   **Service Server**: A node that provides a service. It waits for requests from clients, performs an action, and sends a response.
    *   **Service Client**: A node that sends a request to a service server and waits for a response.
*   **Blocking Communication**: The client typically blocks (waits) until it receives a response from the service server. This makes services suitable for operations that need to complete before the client can proceed, such as triggering an action or querying a specific data point.
*   **Service Types**: Similar to topics, services also have a defined type, specifying the structure of both the request and the response messages.

**Example Scenario**: A navigation node might act as a service *client* to a mapping node, sending a request like "localize me at these coordinates." The mapping node, acting as a service *server*, would process the request and send back a response with the robot's precise location.

## Summary

Nodes, Topics, and Services are the fundamental building blocks for inter-process communication in ROS 2.

*   **Nodes**: Independent computational processes.
*   **Topics**: For asynchronous, one-to-many data streaming (publish/subscribe).
*   **Services**: For synchronous, one-to-one request/response interactions (client/server).

Together, these concepts allow for the creation of robust, modular, and scalable robot applications. In the next chapter, we'll see how to put these concepts into practice using Python.
