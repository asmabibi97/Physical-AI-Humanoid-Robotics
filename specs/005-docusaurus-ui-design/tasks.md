# Tasks: Docusaurus UI, Menu & Footer

**Feature**: `005-docusaurus-ui-design`
**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Plan**: [plan.md](./plan.md)

## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Ensure `src/css/custom.css` exists. If not, create an empty file.

## Phase 2: Foundational Styling (User Story 1 - Consistent Visual Theme)

**Goal**: A reader experiences a consistent blue and white color scheme and clean, modern UI.
**Independent Test**: Visually inspect several pages (home, intro, module pages) for consistent color scheme and overall design.

- [x] T002 Apply blue and white color scheme using Infima CSS variables in `src/css/custom.css`. This includes primary, background, text, link, navbar, and footer colors, and appropriate dark mode adjustments.
- [x] T003 Ensure uniform design and layout structure for all chapters and modules, adhering to modern documentation UI principles (mostly handled by Docusaurus defaults, but fine-tune via `src/css/custom.css` if necessary).

## Phase 3: Navigation Configuration (User Story 2 - Clear Navigation)

**Goal**: A reader can easily navigate through the book using sidebar, navbar, and footer.
**Independent Test**: Use the sidebar, navbar, and footer to navigate to various sections.

- [x] T004 Configure `sidebars.ts` to display all existing modules (Introduction, Module 1, Module 2, Module 3) with collapsible subchapters (this is likely auto-generated by Docusaurus, verify correct configuration).
- [x] T005 Update `docusaurus.config.ts` to include "Introduction" in the navbar.
- [x] T006 Implement a custom NavbarItem React component in `src/theme/NavbarItem/CustomModulesDropdownNavbarItem.js` (or similar path) that dynamically lists all available modules.
- [x] T007 Update `docusaurus.config.ts` to use the custom NavbarItem component for a "Modules" dropdown in the navbar.
- [x] T008 Update `docusaurus.config.ts` to include dedicated links for "Module 1: ROS 2", "Module 2: Digital Twin", "Module 3: AI-Robot Brain", and "Module 4: VLA" in the footer under the "Book" category.
- [x] T009 Update `docusaurus.config.ts` to include general chapter links (e.g., "Introduction") in the footer under the "Book" category.

## Phase 4: Mobile Responsiveness (User Story 3 - Mobile Responsiveness)

**Goal**: The Docusaurus book UI is fully mobile responsive.
**Independent Test**: Access the deployed site on mobile devices or use browser developer tools for various viewports.

- [x] T010 Apply any necessary custom CSS adjustments for mobile responsiveness in `src/css/custom.css` using mobile-first media queries if Docusaurus defaults are insufficient.

## Phase 5: Polish & Validation

- [x] T011 Run the Docusaurus build process (`npm run build`) to ensure all UI/navigation changes are integrated correctly and there are no build errors.
- [x] T012 Review the generated documentation in a browser by running `npm run start` to check for visual consistency, navigation functionality, and mobile responsiveness.
- [ ] T013 Commit and push all UI, sidebar, navbar, and footer updates to GitHub.

## Dependencies

- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1.
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2.
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 3.
- Phase 5 depends on all previous phases.

## Parallel Execution

- Tasks within Phase 2 (T002, T003) can be performed in parallel if CSS for different elements is handled by different team members, but a single developer would likely do them sequentially.
- Tasks within Phase 3 (T005-T009) can be partially parallelized, especially T005 and T008/T009 if different parts of `docusaurus.config.ts` are edited. T006 (custom component) and T007 (config integration) are sequential.

## Implementation Strategy

The strategy is to first establish the foundational CSS styling for the blue and white theme. Then, each navigation element (sidebar, navbar, footer) will be configured and updated, with a custom component for the dynamic modules dropdown in the navbar. Mobile responsiveness will be validated and adjusted. Finally, the site will be built, reviewed, and changes committed and pushed.
