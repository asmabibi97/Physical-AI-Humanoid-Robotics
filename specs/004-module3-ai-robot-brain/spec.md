## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Isaac Ecosystem Understanding (Priority: P1)

An AI or robotics student reads the chapter and can clearly explain the roles and functionalities of NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2.

**Why this priority**: Understanding the core tools is foundational for developing with the NVIDIA Isaac platform for robotics.

**Independent Test**: A student can accurately describe each component (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2) and its primary purpose in the context of AI robotics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student has completed the relevant section, **When** asked to define Isaac Sim, **Then** they can explain its role as a scalable robotics simulation platform.
2. **Given** a student has completed the relevant section, **When** asked about Isaac ROS, **Then** they can describe its function as a collection of hardware-accelerated ROS packages for AI perception.
3. **Given** a student has completed the relevant section, **When** asked about Nav2, **Then** they can explain its capabilities for navigation systems in ROS 2.

### User Story 2 - Advanced Robotics Concepts Comprehension (Priority: P2)

A reader of the chapter understands the concepts of synthetic data, Visual SLAM (VSLAM), and path planning as applied in AI robotics.

**Why this priority**: These concepts are critical for developing intelligent perception and navigation systems for robots.

**Independent Test**: A reader can articulate the meaning and importance of synthetic data, VSLAM, and path planning in robot AI.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader has completed the relevant section, **When** asked about synthetic data, **Then** they can explain its generation and use in training AI models.
2. **Given** a reader has completed the relevant section, **When** asked about VSLAM, **Then** they can describe how it enables a robot to map and localize itself simultaneously using visual input.
3. **Given** a reader has completed the relevant section, **When** asked about path planning, **Then** they can explain the process of generating an optimal path for a robot to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles.

### Key Entities

-   **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: A scalable robotics simulation application and a development platform for building and testing virtual robots.
-   **NVIDIA Isaac ROS**: A collection of hardware-accelerated packages for ROS 2 that enables perception, navigation, and manipulation features on NVIDIA GPUs.
-   **Nav2**: The ROS 2 Navigation Stack, providing a suite of tools for enabling a robot to autonomously navigate an environment.
-   **Synthetic Data**: Data generated by computer simulations or algorithms, often used to train AI models when real-world data is scarce or difficult to obtain.
-   **VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: A technology that allows a robot to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of its own location within that map, using only visual input from cameras.
-   **Path Planning**: The process of finding a sequence of valid configurations that moves a robot from a start configuration to a goal configuration while avoiding obstacles.

### Constraints and Assumptions

- **Constraint**: Word count MUST be between 1,800–2,500 words.
- **Constraint**: The deliverable is a Markdown chapter for Docusaurus.
