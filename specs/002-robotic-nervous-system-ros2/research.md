# Research Findings: Docusaurus Module Structure

**Date**: 2025-12-03
**Feature**: `002-robotic-nervous-system-ros2`

## Objective

The primary unknown for the implementation plan was to determine the correct conventions for adding a new documentation module to the existing Docusaurus website, specifically how to ensure it appears correctly in the sidebar.

## Findings

The research involved inspecting the project's Docusaurus configuration files.

1.  **Sidebar Generation is Automatic**: The `sidebars.ts` file is configured to automatically generate the sidebar from the directory structure within the `docs/` folder. The key line is `tutorialSidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}]`. This means no manual editing of `sidebars.ts` is required for a new module.

2.  **Category Configuration is Key**: To control the appearance and order of a new module (which is a "category" in Docusaurus terms), a `_category_.json` file must be placed in the root of the module's directory.

3.  **`_category_.json` Structure**: This JSON file controls the presentation of the category. Based on `docs/tutorial-basics/_category_.json`, the important fields are:
    *   `label`: (string) The text that appears in the sidebar for the category.
    *   `position`: (number) The numerical order of the category in the sidebar.
    *   `link`: (object) Can be used to generate an index page for the category.

## Conclusion

The "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" from the `plan.md` is resolved. To implement the new "Module 1", a directory `docs/module1` will be created, and within it, a `_category_.json` file will be added to define its sidebar label and position. The content pages will be placed inside `docs/module1`.

**Actionable Next Steps:**
- Create `docs/module1/_category_.json` with `label: "Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System"` and an appropriate `position`.
- Create the content files (`README.md`, `1.1-intro.md`, etc.) inside `docs/module1`.
