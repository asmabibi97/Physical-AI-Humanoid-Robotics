# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the creation of a new documentation module, "Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)," for the Docusaurus website. It will consist of several Markdown files covering physics-based simulation, sensor modeling, and high-fidelity digital twins using Gazebo and Unity. The implementation will follow the structure requested by the user, creating a series of markdown files under a new `docs/module2` directory.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown (for Docusaurus)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus
**Storage**: N/A (File-based content)
**Testing**: Manual validation of Docusaurus build and sidebar navigation.
**Target Platform**: Web (via Docusaurus)
**Project Type**: Documentation update to an existing Docusaurus project.
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: Must integrate with the existing Docusaurus sidebar and navigation structure. Docusaurus conventions from Module 1 (using `_category_.json` for sidebar control) will apply.
**NEEDS CLARIFICATION**:
*   What is the recommended Gazebo version to use for documentation in a robotics context, especially with ROS 2 compatibility?
*   What are common Unity integration patterns for robotics visualization and human-robot interaction in digital twin scenarios?
**Scale/Scope**: One new documentation module with approximately 4-5 sub-pages.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

```

**Structure Decision**: This feature is purely documentation. Changes will be contained within the `docs/` directory. A new `module2` directory will be created to house the chapter files. The existing `sidebars.ts` file will be auto-generated by Docusaurus, picking up the new module.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
